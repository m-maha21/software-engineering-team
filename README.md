# Software Engineering Team Profile Generator App

## Description

My motivation behind this project was to create a tool that simplifies the process of generating a software engineering team profile using a command-line application. 
Through building this project, I gained experience in working with Node.js, the inquirer package for user input, and generating Markdown content dynamically. I learned how to structure a command-line application, handle user input, and generate formatted text output. Additionally, I developed a deeper understanding of the importance of project documentation and the value of automation in improving developer productivity.
